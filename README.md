# Empty or full
This neural network can recognize the presence of an obstacle on the road.
# Project technologies
In this project, I used the ResNet18 pre-trained neural network, which I had trained on data that I had parsed from the Internet. I also used the streamlit library to build my app. 
<br>
The project code is in the file resnet18.py. The neural network is located in the resnet18 file. You can see how the neural network was trained in the jupiter notebook empty-or-full.ipynb file.
<br>
All libraries for this project are described in requirements.txt.
# Why did I create this project?
This project was my Transfer learning task training. I wanted to use a pre-trained neural network in a real project and train it to predict what was not originally intended.
